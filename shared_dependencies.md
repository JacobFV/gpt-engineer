Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files "architecture_spec.py" and "code_understanding.py" might include:

1. `CodeParser`: A class or function that is used to parse and understand the code architecture. This could be a shared dependency as both files need to understand the code architecture.

2. `ArchitectureSpec`: A class or data schema that represents the architecture specification. This would be used in "architecture_spec.py" to write the spec and in "code_understanding.py" to understand the spec.

3. `CodeElements`: A list or dictionary that stores the id names of every DOM elements that the JavaScript functions will use. This could be a shared dependency as both files might need to interact with these elements.

4. `ParseMessage`: A message name that is used when the code parsing is complete. This could be a shared dependency as both files might need to know when the parsing is complete.

5. `WriteSpecMessage`: A message name that is used when the architecture spec writing is complete. This could be a shared dependency as both files might need to know when the writing is complete.

6. `parse_code()`: A function name that is used to parse the code. This could be a shared dependency as both files might need to parse the code.

7. `write_spec()`: A function name that is used to write the architecture spec. This could be a shared dependency as both files might need to write the spec.
